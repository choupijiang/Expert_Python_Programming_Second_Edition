# Chapter 3. Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level
# 第三章 语法最佳实践－类的本质

We will now focus on syntax best practices for classes. It is not intended to cover design patterns here, as they will be discussed in Chapter 14, Useful Design Patterns. This chapter gives an overview of the advanced Python syntax to manipulate and enhance the class code.  

我们现在关注的是类的语法最佳实践。

Object model evolved greatly during history of Python 2. For a long time we lived in a world where two implementations of the object-oriented programming paradigm coexisted in the same language. These two models were simply referred to as old-style and new-style classes. Python 3 ended this dichotomy and only model known as new-style classes is available to the developers. Anyway, it is still important to know how both of them worked in Python 2 because it will help you in porting old code and writing backwards compatible applications. Knowing how the object model changed will also help you in understanding why it is designed that way right now. This is the reason why the following chapter will have a relatively large number of notes about old Python 2 features despite this book targets the latest Python 3 releases.  

对象模型在历经Python 2之后有了极大的进化。

The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:  

下面是我们本章要讨论的议题：  

- Subclassing built-in types
- Accessing methods from super classes
- Using properties and slots
- Metaprogramming

- 子类化内建类型
- 从超类访问方法
- 使用特性和槽
- 元编程

## Subclassing built-in types 子类化内建类型

Subclassing built-in types in Python is pretty straightforward. A built-in type called object is a common ancestor for all built-in types as well as all user-defined classes that have no explicit parent class specified. Thanks to this, every time a class that behaves almost like one of the built-in types needs to be implemented, the best practice is to subtype it.  

子类化Python的内建类型相当简单直接。

Now, we will show you the code for a class called distinctdict, which uses this technique. It is a subclass of the usual Python dict type. This new class behaves in most ways like an ordinary Python dict. But instead of allowing multiple keys with the same value, when someone tries to add a new entry with an identical value, it raises a ValueError subclass with a help message:  

现在，我们向你展示称做distdict类的代码，

```python
class DistinctError(ValueError):
    """
    Raised when duplicate value is added to a distinctdict.
    当重复的值被加入到distinctdict时抛出。
    """

class distinctdict(dict):
    """
    Dictionary that does not accept duplicate values.
    字典不接受重复的值。
    """
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if value in self.values():
            if (
                (key in self and self[key] != value) or
                key not in self
            ):
                raise DistinctError(
                    "This value already exists for different key"
                )

        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

The following is an example of using distictdict in interactive session:  

下面是一个在交互终端中使用distdict的例子：  

```
>>> my = distinctdict()
>>> my['key'] = 'value'
>>> my['other_key'] = 'value'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<input>", line 10, in __setitem__
DistinctError: This value already exists for different key
>>> my['other_key'] = 'value2'
>>> my
{'key': 'value', 'other_key': 'value2'}
```

If you take a look at your existing code, you may find a lot of classes that partially implement the built-in types, and could be faster and cleaner as subtypes. The list type, for instance, manages the sequences and could be used every time a class works internally with a sequence:   

如果你看看现有的代码，你可以发现很多类部分实现了内建类型，而且作为子类型可以更快，更整洁。例如，list类型，管理序列

```python
class Folder(list):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def dir(self, nesting=0):
        offset = "  " * nesting
        print('%s%s/' % (offset, self.name))

        for element in self:
            if hasattr(element, 'dir'):
                element.dir(nesting + 1)
            else:
                print("%s  %s" % (offset, element))
```
